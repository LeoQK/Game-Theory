### Discounted Transfer Game

The transfer game (DTG) is a game theoretical model of negotiations, specifically in their mediated form, where agents aim to find an optimal manner of conceding to their counterpart.


**Objective:** The problem that the DTG models is an optimization problem. How can I make an optimal concession to a global counterpart whose utilities I do not know and whose strategy I want to align with my own strategy, while considering that the size of concessions I can make is limited by my need to maintain a robust standing in the interaction with my local counterpart?

**Components of the DTG:** 

• Two 2x2 normal form games, ONE and TWO, with two players and two strategies

• A broker that is modeled as a mediating entity between the two games

In the DTG, each player is part of two interactions:

• A local interaction that differs by player type. This interaction is modeled as the conventional game play between a player 1 and player 2 inside each of the two games.

• A global interaction that differs by game type. This interaction is modeled inside pairs of players, where a pair compromises two players, one from each game.
